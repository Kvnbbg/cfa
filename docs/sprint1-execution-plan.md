# Project Velocity — Sprint 1 Execution Plan

## Sprint Overview
- **Objective:** Establish the automation, security, and observability foundations required to safely deliver the Expansion Blueprint’s feature work.
- **Timebox:** 2 weeks
- **Team Cadence:** Daily stand-up focused on CI telemetry, observability dashboards, and experiment read-outs. Weekly stakeholder sync for blueprint alignment.

## Backlog Items

| # | Scope | Definition of Done | Try-Test Strategy | Expected KPI / DORA Impact |
|---|-------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | **Continuous Verification Pipeline**<br>Implement `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running lint (`ruff`), static security (`bandit`, `pip-audit`), unit/integration tests on Python 3.10 & 3.11 with coverage uploads.<br>Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml` mirroring CI checks.<br>Update `README.md` & `DEPLOYMENT.md` with pipeline instructions and status badge. | • All workflow jobs green on main and PR branches.<br>• Pre-commit hooks installable via `pre-commit install`.<br>• Docs include troubleshooting + badge URLs.<br>• Coverage threshold ≥80% enforced in CI. | **Canary CI Rollout:** Enable the workflow on a dedicated branch, validate on two pilot PRs, then require status checks for all branches after 3 consecutive green runs. Monitor GitHub Actions success rate dashboard. | ↓ Lead Time for Changes, ↓ Change Failure Rate, ↑ Deployment Frequency as PR gates automate validation. |
| 2 | **Secrets & Access Hardening**<br>Replace dev-only admin bootstrap with a Flask CLI command requiring env-supplied hashed credentials (bcrypt).<br>Parameterize security log destination with `CFA_SECURITY_LOG` env var, auto-create directory with least privilege.<br>Add `CODEOWNERS` for sensitive paths and integrate `gitleaks` scan in CI. | • CLI command `flask create-admin` reads `FLASK_ADMIN_EMAIL` & `FLASK_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` and persists unique admin.<br>• Logging works in Docker/non-root environments; failures surface actionable errors.<br>• `CODEOWNERS` enforced, secret scanning job blocks merges on findings. | **10% Production Canary:** Roll CLI + logging changes to staging and 10% of production containers using feature flag `SECURITY_HARDENING_V1`. Monitor authentication success/error ratios and filesystem permission alerts; roll to 100% after 48h clean window. | ↓ Security incident probability, ↓ MTTR via accessible logs, Maintains deployment velocity with controlled rollout. |
| 3 | **Telemetry & Observability Baseline**<br>Add structured JSON logging with correlation IDs, integrate OpenTelemetry traces & metrics for cache, auth, and rate limiter.<br>Extend watchdog events to emit OTLP counters.<br>Document taxonomy in `docs/observability.md`; update deployment guide with Prometheus & OTLP endpoints. | • Local docker-compose stack emits traces viewable in Jaeger; metrics scrapeable by Prometheus.<br>• Alert rules (CPU, memory, auth anomalies) stored in repo and linked from docs.<br>• Observability documentation reviewed by platform owner. | **Synthetic Load Trial:** Run k6/Gatling synthetic traffic during staging deploy to validate telemetry signal quality. Compare baseline vs. instrumented latency & error metrics; promote when delta <3% and dashboards verified by SRE. | ↓ MTTR thanks to traceability, ↓ Change Failure Rate by correlating releases with telemetry, ↑ Availability confidence. |
| 4 | **Authentication Integration Tests**<br>Author `tests/routes/test_user.py` covering successful login, invalid credentials, expired token, and protected `/profile` access.<br>Configure pytest, coverage, and fixture factories for isolated DB state. Update `todo.md`/developer docs with testing status. | • `pytest` executes locally & in CI with deterministic fixtures.<br>• Coverage for `src/routes/user.py` ≥80% with failure gating CI.<br>• Docs describe running tests & debugging failures. | **Blue/Green Validation:** Run the new suite against both current and forthcoming auth implementations (blue/green) each pipeline run to detect regressions before release. Publish coverage delta in CI summary. | ↑ Change Failure Detection, ↑ Deployment Frequency via increased confidence, Stabilizes MTTR for auth incidents. |

## Sprint Monitoring & Feedback Loop
1. **During Execution**
   - Track CI pipeline pass rate, job duration, and flake frequency.
   - Observe OpenTelemetry dashboards (latency P95, cache hit/miss, auth error rate) once instrumentation lands.
   - Review experiment metrics: canary adoption stats, synthetic load outcomes, blue/green test deltas.
2. **Incident Response**
   - Any regression in experiments or telemetry triggers an immediate hold on rollout plus RCA doc template (`docs/rca-template.md`, created during sprint if needed).

## Exit Criteria & Demo
- Live demo of CI pipeline on PR, highlighting lint, security scan, tests, and coverage gate.
- Walkthrough of new admin provisioning CLI and environment-driven logging configuration.
- Presentation of observability dashboards populated from synthetic load test.
- Pytest report showing ≥80% coverage for auth routes with documented run instructions.

## Post-Sprint Data Collection
- Export GitHub Actions metrics to seed DORA dashboard (script backlog for Sprint 2).
- Archive experiment results (canary logs, synthetic load metrics, blue/green diff) in `/DATA/experiments/sprint1/` for future reference.
