# Top 20 Developer Mistakes: OWASP-Anchored Pentest Checklist

This checklist reframes the “Top 20 developer mistakes” as a black-box pentest workflow, explicitly mapped to the OWASP Top 10 taxonomy. It supports both the OWASP Top 10:2021 categories and the latest OWASP Top 10:2025 (RC/2025 edition) structure to keep reporting aligned with current industry language.

## OWASP Top 10 mapping: 2021 vs 2025

**OWASP Top 10:2021 (baseline mapping)**
- A01: Broken Access Control
- A02: Cryptographic Failures
- A03: Injection
- A04: Insecure Design
- A05: Security Misconfiguration
- A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- A07: Identification and Authentication Failures
- A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures
- A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**OWASP Top 10:2025 (latest structure)**
- A01: Broken Access Control
- A02: Security Misconfiguration
- A03: Software Supply Chain Failures
- A04: Cryptographic Failures
- A05: Injection
- A06: Insecure Design
- A07: Authentication Failures
- A08: Software or Data Integrity Failures
- A09: Security Logging and Alerting Failures
- A10: Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions

Operationally, the 2025 list makes supply chain and exception handling explicit. Use the 2025 categories in new reports and cross-map to 2021 for legacy comparability.

## The “Top 20 mistakes” as actionable pentest findings

1. **Permitting invalid data into the database**
   - Pentest signal: missing server-side validation, inconsistent states, error messages, odd edge-case behavior.
   - Maps to: Injection / Insecure Design / Security Misconfiguration (depending on root cause).

2. **Focusing on the system as a whole (instead of trust boundaries)**
   - Pentest signal: authorization assumed “somewhere else,” missing object/action checks, microservice-to-microservice trust gaps.
   - Maps to: Broken Access Control / Insecure Design.

3. **Personally developed security methods (“homegrown crypto/auth”)**
   - Pentest signal: bespoke token formats, nonstandard signing/encryption, ad-hoc password hashing.
   - Maps to: Cryptographic Failures / Authentication Failures.

4. **Treating security as the last step**
   - Pentest signal: systemic control gaps across modules, repeated insecure patterns, inconsistent controls.
   - Maps to: Insecure Design.

5. **Plain-text password storage**
   - Pentest signal: breach impact becomes catastrophic; password reuse cascade.
   - Maps to: Cryptographic Failures / Authentication Failures.

6. **Weak passwords**
   - Pentest signal: account takeover via credential stuffing/password spraying (if in scope), weak policy, weak reset flows.
   - Maps to: Authentication Failures.

7. **Storing unencrypted data in the database**
   - Pentest signal: PII/secrets visible at rest; backups/exports leak; over-privileged reads.
   - Maps to: Cryptographic Failures.

8. **Depending excessively on the client side**
   - Pentest signal: “disabled button” security; client-side role flags; hidden fields deciding price/role.
   - Maps to: Broken Access Control / Insecure Design.

9. **Being too optimistic (“users won’t do that”)**
   - Pentest signal: missing abuse-case design; no rate limits; predictable identifiers; weak anti-automation.
   - Maps to: Insecure Design / Authentication Failures.

10. **Permitting variables via the URL path name**
    - Pentest signal: IDOR/BOLA patterns; object IDs swapped; path-based authorization missing.
    - Maps to: Broken Access Control.

11. **Trusting third-party code**
    - Pentest signal: vulnerable dependencies; risky plugins; supply-chain exposure; weak update governance.
    - Maps to: Vulnerable/Outdated Components (2021) and Software Supply Chain Failures (2025).

12. **Hard-coding backdoor accounts**
    - Pentest signal: undocumented privileged users; default creds; “support” accounts; hidden admin routes.
    - Maps to: Authentication Failures / Broken Access Control.

13. **Unverified injections**
    - Pentest signal: injection sinks in query/filters/search; inconsistent output; server errors; data-dependent behavior.
    - Maps to: Injection.

14. **Remote file inclusions (RFI)**
    - Pentest signal: dynamic include of remote resources; template/include parameters; risky interpreters.
    - Maps to: Injection / Security Misconfiguration.

15. **Insecure data handling (logs, exports, debug dumps)**
    - Pentest signal: secrets in logs; verbose errors; PII in URLs; unsafe data sharing across tenants.
    - Maps to: Security Misconfiguration / Logging failures / Broken Access Control.

16. **Failing to encrypt data properly**
    - Pentest signal: weak modes, wrong key management, TLS gaps, broken at-rest protection.
    - Maps to: Cryptographic Failures.

17. **Not using a secure cryptographic system (again: “homegrown”)**
    - Pentest signal: nonstandard primitives, poor entropy, bad key rotation.
    - Maps to: Cryptographic Failures.

18. **Ignoring layer 8 (people/process)**
    - Pentest signal: weak operational controls, poor secrets hygiene, risky admin workflows, social engineering exposure (if in scope).
    - Maps to: often shows up as Misconfiguration / Authentication Failures / Logging failures.

19. **Failing to review user actions (logging/monitoring gaps)**
    - Pentest signal: no audit trails; no alerting on sensitive operations; no traceability for abuse.
    - Maps to: Security Logging & Monitoring Failures (2021) / Logging & Alerting Failures (2025).

20. **WAF misconfigurations**
    - Pentest signal: false sense of security; bypassable rules; blocks normal traffic; inconsistent enforcement.
    - Maps to: Security Misconfiguration (and sometimes Exception Handling in 2025 if errors are mishandled).

## Turning the list into a disciplined black-box workflow

1. **Surface mapping**: identify auth boundaries, roles, tenant model, and high-value actions (money, data export, admin).
2. **Abuse-case testing**: per action, test “same user / different user / no auth / lower role” patterns.
3. **Input handling**: test each input class (path, query, body, headers, file upload, template/lang selectors) against injection, file inclusion, SSRF-like fetches, and deserialization-like behaviors.
4. **Observability**: verify what gets logged, what alerts, and whether sensitive ops are attributable (user/action/object/time).

## Reporting guidance

- Use OWASP Top 10:2025 categories for current reporting.
- Cross-map to 2021 only when clients require legacy alignment.
- Call out explicit supply chain and exception handling issues when present, even if the original “mistakes” list predates these categories.
